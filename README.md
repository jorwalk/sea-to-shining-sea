# Sea To Shining Sea

- What is my inspiration for this article?
 
If tomorrow a flying drone was available to the general public
I would want to travel to all 50 capitals

If you wanted to visit the capital of all 50 states, what would be the most optimal order.


```
 $ python3 -m pip install ortools
 $ python3 -m pip install geopy
```

```
$ python3 map.py
```
## Data
TBD: json file with lon lat of all 50 capitals
```
{
    "abbr": "MO",
    "name": "Missouri",
    "capital": "Jefferson City",
    "lat": "38.572954",
    "long": "-92.189283"
}
```

## Python Libraries
TBD: Talk about the libraries that I used in python, what was there purpose

## Openlayers Visualizations
TBD: Stamen terrain basemap

## Flask App
